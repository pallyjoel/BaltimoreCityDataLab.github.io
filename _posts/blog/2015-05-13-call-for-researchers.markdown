To construct and launch the BDL, we seek volunteers who can (a) help to develop an open-science web presence for the lab, (b) help to link the BDL to other existing open data sources, and (c) help to scrape new data from the web, from visual and audio files, and from social and traditional media sources.  A very modest amount of funding, as a seed grant from the 21st Century City Initiative at Johns Hopkins University, is available to help meet the direct costs of these activities.

As a first collective volunteer project, we will be coding “Signal 13” events (urgent "officer in distress" calls) from scanner recordings of Baltimore Police Department activity on Monday April 27th and Tuesday April 28th.  The information gleaned from this activity will be merged with extant data on Baltimore neighborhoods and what is known about the distribution of incidents from social and traditional media as well as municipal sources, both on April 27th and 28th and in the past.
